Identifying a clear vision and mission is critical for developing a strong business strategy. A vision statement communicates the long-term aspirations of the business, while a mission statement defines the purpose and values of the business.

To effectively define your mission, entrepreneurs should:

* Consider the core values and principles of the business.
